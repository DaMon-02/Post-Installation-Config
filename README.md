<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

This is the portion where I configure roles to make it similar to a helpdesk enviornment that works with a ticketing system. I will basically give out postions to "workers" that I create. I will first create the role of a Supreme Admin then within that role I will configure the "depatments". This will allow me to assign the workers that I have created a job. Within these jobs there are certain things that they can and cannot do depending on their roles, so an example would be ticket visibility, I assign who can see and work on tickets. I then go a step further to create departments and teams. For example, I have a team of agents who works for an "Online Banking" deparment. I will list photo examples below showing my configurations on this project.

In the screenshot posted above this is where I can give permissions to the workers depending on their roles on the job. I have the ability to give them expanded access, limited access or veiw only access.

The screenshot posted above is just showing more options that I have as a Supreme Admin, these are the options that give to the workers or things the I can prohibit them from.
